## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I improved my understanding of responsive design and the importance of a mobile-first workflow. I used CSS custom properties to maintain a consistent design system and flexbox for the layout, which allowed me to manage the content effectively across different screen sizes.

A key challenge I overcame was ensuring that images and text adjusted seamlessly without requiring horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to dive deeper into CSS Grid and explore more advanced responsive design techniques.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to properly utilize flexbox for layout, especially in a mobile-first context.
